## Simple Summary

To provide vote related operations in TVM.

## Abstract

VoteWitness & WithdrawReward operations in system contract are introduced, smart contract can vote for witness and get reward from the system.

## Motivation

Common user can vote for activated witness to share the block reward. However, non-privatekey accounts, like smart contracts, can not get benefit from this incentive mechanism. 

Meanwhile, after [TIP-157](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-157.md) activating on the mainnet, smart contracts can freeze their balance to get resources include tron power. But this part of resources can not be used because there is no vote related instructions in TVM.

So this TIP aims to implement the incentive voting functionalities for smart contracts. On one hand, smart contracts will take fully advantage of their balance. For example, voting witness, keeping the network safe, sharing the block reward. On the other hand, developer could write some special voting contracts to provide a new way to vote witness for common user which is different from system voting contract. These voting contracts may be more complex to system voting contract and provide more attractive and unique voting feature.

## Specifications

### New instructions

#### `0xd8`: `VOTEWITNESS`

The `VOTE` takes 4 operands pop up from stack:

`tronPowerArrayLength`: witness address array offset.

`tronPowerArrayOffset`: witness address array size.

`witnessAddressArrayLength`: tron power number array offset.

`witnessAddressArrayOffset`: tron power number array size.

TVM will get witness array from memory by using `witnessOffset` and `witnessSize`.

TVM will get tron power array from memory by using `tronPowerOffset` and `tronPowerSize`.

Execute vote function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwize.

#### `0xd9`: `WITHDRAWREWARD`

The `WITHDRAWREWARD` takes no operand pop up from stack.

Execute withdraw function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwise.

### New precompile contracts

#### `0x1000005`: `RewardBalance`

The `RewardBalance` takes no operand pop up from stack.

Execute query reward function and push reward balance to stack.

#### `0x1000006`: `IsSrCandidate`

The `IsSrCandidate` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`targetAddress`: target account address.

Push 0 if target address is not a witness, otherwise push 1.

#### `0x1000007`: `VoteCount`

The `VoteCount` takes 2 operand pop up from stack:

`voteAddress`: vote account address.

`targetAddress`: target account address.

Execute query vote count function and push vote count to stack.

#### `0x1000008`: `UsedVoteCount`

The `UsedVoteCount` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`voteAddress`: vote account address.

Execute query total used vote count function.

#### `0x1000009`: `ReceivedVoteCount`

The `ReceviedVoteCount` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`receivedAddress`: witness address.

Excute query witness total received vote count.

#### `0x100000a`: `TotalVoteCount`

The `TotalVoteCount` takes 1 operand pop up from stack:

`voteAddress`: vote account address.

Execute query total vote count function.


### Solidity Example

```solidity

    /**
     * @dev Contract can accept value while creating.
     */
    constructor() public payable {
    }

    /**
     * @dev Freeze `amount` balance of contract to get resource for `receiver` 
     * which type is `res` (0 for bandwidth, 1 for energy).

     * 1. `amount` is greater than long.max_value or contract balance
     * 2. `amount` is less than 10e6 sun (1 trx)
     * 3. `res` is not zero or one

     * below situations can cause `revert` excepiton:

     * 2. array length are greater than MAX_VOTE_NUMBER (30)
     * 3. there are normal account address in `srList` array
     * 4. there are negative value in 'tpList' array
     * 5. total needed tron power is greater than current owned tron power of contract

     */

     */
    function killme(address payable target) external {
        selfdestruct(target);

```

#### Notice

For `vote(address[], uint[])`, if array length in memory does not match the parameter length, a `ByteExecutionException` will throw.

For `vote(address[], uint[])`, if `address` array length and `uint` array length is different, a `revert` exception will throw.

For `withdrawreward()`, withdraw all rewards to contract balance.

Both `vote(address[], uint[])` and `withdrawreward()` will change the state of storage, so they can not be executed in `static` context (a `static` context can only be created by `staticcall` now). Otherwise, a `StaticCallModificationException` will throw.

### New reward calculation algorithm

See author`s blog for more details of the algorithm at [Read the docs](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/CfJEyFx2Slyp9kUD-e9qow)

## Rationale

### Tier

`VOTEWITNESS`: tier.ExtTier

`WITHDRAWREWARD`: tier.ExtTier

### Energy cost

#### Instructions

`VOTEWITNESS`: 30000 energy

`WITHDRAWREWARD`: 20000 energy

#### Precomplie contracts

`RewardBalance`: 500 energy

`IsSrCandidate`: 20 energy

`VoteCount`: 500 energy

`UsedVoteCount`: 20 energy

`ReceivedVoteCount`: 20 energy

`TotalVoteCount`: 20 energy


### Selfdestruct

If contract still has votes and unwithdrawed reward, selfdestruct will auto clear votes and withdraw allowance and reward to contract balance. There may be some rewards of current cycle that can never be withdrawed.
