## Simple Summary (required)

Send the transaction fee which includes the bandwidth and energy to the witness.

## Abstract (required)

There are two ingredients needed to calculate transaction fees in Tron, which are called bandwidth and energy, and they are sent to the blackhole. Now we can send these two to the witness as part of the reward.


## Motivation (required)

In order to motivate the witnesses, we plan to send the transaction fee, including the bandwidth and energy cost, to the witnesses as part of the reward.

## Specification (required)

Every time after one block is produced, we can calculate all the bandwidth and energy of the transactions, and send it totally to the witness which produces the block.

Specifically, if the transaction is timeout, there will not be any reward for this transaction.


## Rationale (required)

Set the reward of one transaction which is timeout to be zero, can avoid cheating and make ensure the stability.


## Implementation (required)
