## Simple Summary
To provide TRC10 And TRC20 Conversion Contract Standard.

## Abstract


## Motivation
As stated in the tip-153, Tron-DEX is written by the system contract, 
so it cannot directly support TRC20 token trading technically.

However, TRC20 token is an important part of the TRON network, Including TRC20-USDT, and so on. 
Many projects release TRC20 tokens, and a considerable portion of the market value of the network is also carried on TRC20 tokens.

We need a conversion method that can convert between TRC10 and TRC20 to support TRC20 trading in Tron DEX.

The conversion method through a smart contract seems to be a more feasible, simple, and safe method.

With this standard, all TRC20 issuers or trusted third parties can independently create a platform 
for TRC20 to TRC10 conversion. Ordinary users can also convert TRC20 to TRC10 in this trusted way, 
and then conveniently trade in Tron DEX.

If there is no standard, each issuer may design its own contract with potential security risks, and 
it is difficult for users to verify the security of conversion contracts issued by the issuer.

So maybe we need a contract standard.
