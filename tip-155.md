## Simple Summary
To support issuing TRC10 related operations in TVM.

## Abstract


## Motivation
As stated in the Tip-154. It is necessary to support the conversion of TRC10 and 
TRC20, and supporting this conversion through a smart contract should be a safe and feasible method.

Contract security is a key factor. This conversion contract should be strictly bound to the 
converted TRC10 and TRC20, and cannot be modified once set. Therefore, users do not have to worry 
about the issuer adjusting the TRC10 and TRC20 within the contract after the contract is issued.

If the contract can issue TRC10, all corresponding TRC10 belong to this contract instead of the 
issuer, and the issuer cannot change and operate TRC10 in the contract. This ensures the safety of 
the conversion contract.

Therefore, the function of issuing TRC10 in the contract should be supported.
