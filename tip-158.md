## Simple Summary

To provide Staking operations in TVM.

## Abstract

This is a simplified solution for PoS incentive mechanism in smart contract. Can be regard as an opimization for the combination of [tip-156](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-156.md) and [tip-157](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/tip-156.md).

## Motivation

Though we plan to provide `FREEZE`, `VOTE`, `UNFREEZE` instructions in smart contract for block reward dividend, it is confused to developers in some circumstances. It is necessary to give a simplified solution for Smart Contract developers.

## Specification

The following instructions are introduced:

### `0xd5`: `STAKE`

STAKE is a trx staking to get TRON Powever and voting SR process.

FACTS:

1. STAKE ONLY available for single SR.
2. As long as a STAKE be executed, it is not adding a vote information, but replacing the entire vote information belongs to the contract itself.

The `STAKE` takes 2 operands pop up from stack:

`sr_address`: the target address to vote.

`stake_amount`: TRX amount to freeze in SUN.

Will process following logic:

1. Contract stake trx as bandwidth and add the frozen amount to its `Account.frozenBalance`. The default staking period is 3 days.
2. Increase bandwidth weight in the whole network
3. Contract update vote information in voteStore and accountStore (**this will replace the entire vote state for owner, not append**)

Execute STAKE function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwise.

### `0xd6`: `UNSTAKE`

The `UNSTAKE` takes 0 operands from stack.

Will process following logic:

1. 3 days after the last `STAKE` operation for this contract, the contract can choose to `UNSTAKE` its TRX.
2. Update block produce reward balance for this contract.
3. Unfrozne balance in contract.
4. Decrease bandwidth weight in the whole network.
5. Contract clears vote information.

Execute UNSTAKE function and push 0 to stack if fail, push 1 otherwise.

## Rationale

### `STAKE` tier.ExtTier

7 key changes:

dynamiceStore: `TOTAL_NET_WEIGHT`

AccountStore: the contract account key

delegateStore: `Remark`,`BeginCycle`,`EndCycle`,`AccountVote`

VoteStore: the contract vote key

35,000 Energy = 7 * 5000

### `UNSTAKE` tier.ExtTier

dynamiceStore: `TOTAL_NET_WEIGHT`

AccountStore: the contract account key

delegateStore: `Remark`,`BeginCycle`,`EndCycle`,`AccountVote`

VoteStore: the contract vote key

35,000 Energy = 7 * 5000
