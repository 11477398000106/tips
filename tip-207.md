title: A proposal to improve network resources model

## Simple Summary 
This proposal proposes a new scheme to try to solve the problem of the low utilization rate of network frozen resources, 
reduce user usage costs, and improve resource models.

The core idea is that freezing TRX only gets bandwidth, energy, or voting right.

In order to guarantee the stability of the network and the rights of users,
the voting right and resources obtained before can be retained at the same time.

## Motivation
Currently, freezing TRX can obtain bandwidth or energy, while obtaining voting rights. 
Many accounts freeze a large amount of TRX for voting only but do not use resources. 
This results in accounts that really need resources only get a small part of resources and network resources are wasted. 

## Specification
There are two new parameters will be added into account data structure:
"old_tron_power" and "tron_power".

"old_tron_power" is used to record the tron power before the proposal, which is the sum of frozen trx for the bandwidth and energy.

"tron_power" is used to record the tron power after the proposal.

```
message Account {
...
int64 old_tron_power = 46;
Frozen tron_power = 47;
}
```


In the FreezeBalanceContract, TRON_POWER is added into ResourceCode.
```
enum ResourceCode {
BANDWIDTH = 0x00;
ENERGY = 0x01;
TRON_POWER = 0x02;
}
```

There is a new chain parameter called TOTAL_TRON_POWER_WEIGHT, which is used to record the new tron power in the whole network.
```
private static final byte[] TOTAL_TRON_POWER_WEIGHT = "TOTAL_TRON_POWER_WEIGHT".getBytes();
```

Add some tronPower info into AccountResourceMessage. Users could get tron power info using "GetAccountResource" 。
TotalTronPowerWeight is the total new tron power that users freeze for TRON_POWER in the whole network.
TronPowerLimit is the total tron power the user has, include old tron power and new tron power.
tronPowerUsed is the tron power the user already used for votes.

```
message AccountResourceMessage {
  int64 TotalTronPowerWeight = 9;
  int64 tronPowerUsed = 10;
  int64 tronPowerLimit = 11;
}
```

## Implementation
Before the proposal, the tron power of an account is the sum of frozen trx for the bandwidth and energy.

After the proposal, the all tron power of an account includes the "old_tron_power", and the new "tron_power", 
where the "old_tron_power" representative the past tron power which 
will be calculated and initialized when an account performs a freezing related operation, include voting a witness and freezing new trx.
"old_tron_power" will not increase even if the account freeze more trx for the bandwidth and energy.

Pay attention, "old_tron_power" will be clear when the account sent an unfreeze operation, includes unfreezing BANDWIDTH、ENERGY or TRON_POWER, and will not set anymore.

The new "tron_power" could be obtained only by freezing trx for TRON_POWER.

In normal, the votes of an account will be clear when the account sent an unfreeze operation, unless the "old_tron_power" is equal to -1, and the operation is unfreezing BANDWIDTH OR ENERGY.
When the "old_tron_power" is equal to -1, the votes must come from the new "tron_power", unfreezing BANDWIDTH OR ENERGY should not affect the votes.

In addition, tron power is not allowed to delegate to other accounts.

## Backward Compatibility
There are no backward compatibility concerns.

## Test Cases
1. Check the "old_tron_power" is correct after a freezing related operation.
2. Check the "old_tron_power" is clear after an unfreeze operation.
3. Check the tron power is the sum of "old_tron_power" and "tron_power".
