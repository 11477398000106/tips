## Simple Summary

This TIP aims to add a proposal to make the `TOTAL_NET_LIMIT` parameter configurable.

## Abstract

The total net limit stands for the bandwidth resource distributed to all the users when they freeze their TRX balances.
At present, the total net limit `TOTAL_NET_LIMIT` parameter is set as a fixed value of 43.2 billion according to a rough estimate, which is not flexible enough to adapt to the rapid development of the TRON network. So we propose to change the total net limit parameter as configurable.


## Motivation
The current fixed `TOTAL_NET_LIMIT` parameter is estimated by the following equation:
```
43,200,000,000 = 500 * 1000 * 86400
```
where `500` stands for the average transaction byte size, `1000` stands for TPS, and `86400` stands for the total number of seconds in a day.

However, the estimated value is not accurate. Instead of being a fixed value, it is better to make the `TOTAL_NET_LIMIT` parameter configurable.


## Specification

The `TOTAL_NET_LIMIT` proposal type is defined as :
```java
 public enum ProposalType {
  ...
  TOTAL_NET_LIMIT(62); // 43_200_000_000L, [0, 1000_000_000_000L]
  ...
 }
```
The proposal code is `62` and its initial value is set `43,200,000,000`. The valid range of `TOTAL_NET_LIMIT`  parameter is `[0, 1000,000,000,000]`.


## Rationale
It is quite necessary to adjust the total net limit to adapt to different situations in the TRON network.
