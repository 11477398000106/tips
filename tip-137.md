## Simple Summary 

The TIP provides the zero-knowledge proof verification functions in shielded contract, which can be used in shielded token transactions.

## Abstract 

The TIP introduces three new functions: `verifyMintProof`, `verifyTransferProof`, and `verifyBurnProof`, which can accelerate the zero-knowledge verification for the `mint`, `transfer` and `burn` processing in shielded token contract. 

## Motivation 

In order to implement shielded transaction for [TRC-20](https://github.com/tronprotocol/TIPs/blob/master/tip-20.md) token,  We have developed the shielded token contract. The contract has three core modules: `mint`, `transfer` and `burn`. `mint` is used to transform the public TRC-20 tokens into shielded tokens. `transfer` is used for shielded  token transactions. `burn` is  used to transform the shielded  tokens back to public TRC-20 tokens.  The shielded contract is implemented based on zero-knowledge proof, so it needs the complex zero-knowledge proof verification in `mint`, `transfer` and `burn` methods. In order to accelerate the speed, we will make use of  the new functions in the contract to implement the verification process. 

## Specification

The following define the methods implementation for shielded token contract. 

### Preliminaries
**NoteCommitment**

The TRC-20 token is tranformed into shielded token in the form of commitment by cryptographic method, which is defined as:

    *note<sub>-</sub>commitment = NoteCommitment<sub>r</sub>(v)*

The `v` value is hided by  `note_commitment` with the blinding factor `r`.

**SpendDescription**

The `SpendDescription` includes zk-SNARK proof related data, which is used as the input of shielded token transaction. 

```text  
message SpendDescription { 
  bytes value_commitment = 1; // value commitment
  bytes anchor = 2; // merkle root
  bytes nullifier = 3; // used for check double spend
  bytes rk = 4; // used for check spend spend authority signature
  bytes zkproof = 5; // zk-SNARK proof
  bytes spend_authority_signature = 6; //spend authority signature 
}
```

**ReceiveDescription**

The `ReceiveDescrion` also includes zk-SNARK proof related data, which is used as the output of shielded token transaction.

```text  
message ReceiveDescription { 
  bytes value_commitment = 1; // value commitment used for binding signature
  byte  note_commitment = 2;  // note commitment used for hiding the value
  bytes epk = 3;  // ephemeral public key used for encryption
  bytes c_enc = 4;  // encryption for note plaintext
  bytes c_out = 5; // encryption for audit
  bytes zkproof = 6; // zk-SNARK proof 
}
```

### Function

(1)`verifyMintProof` 

`verifyMintProof` function is used to verify the validity of zero-knowledge proof when transforming the public TRC-20 token into shielded tokens.  

```
byte[320] input = abi.encode(value_commitment, epk, zkproof, bindingSig)
byte[1480] total_intput = abi.encode(note_commitment, input, value, signHash, frontier, leafCount)
bytes memory msg = verifyMintProof(total_intput);
```

- `bindingSig` - the binding signature
- `value` - the amount of TRC-20 tokens to be shielded
- `signHash` - the message hash for the binding signature
- `frontier` - used to compute the Merkle tree root
- `leafCount` - the leaf number in the Merkle tree
- The other parameters are specified in the above preliminaries

```
[32 bytes for note_commitment][32 bytes for value_commitment][32 bytes for epk][192 bytes for zkproof][64 bytes for bindingSig][8 bytes for value][32 bytes for signHash][1056 bytes for frontier][32 bytes for leafCount]
```

The length of `total_input` is 1480 bytes. For the output, the length of `msg` is 34~1058 bytes. Its first byte is a bool value to indicate whether the proof verification succeeds,  and the other bytes return the node value to construct the Merkle tree. The time cost of `verifyMintProof` function takes about 10ms.

（2）`verifyTransferProof` 

`verifyTransferProof` function is used to verify the validity of zero-knowledge proof for shielded tokens transactions.  

```
byte[320] input = abi.encode(value_commitment, rk, spend_authority_signature, zkproof)
byte[288] output1 = abi.encode(value_commitment, note_commitment, epk, zkproof)
byte[288] output2 = abi.encode(value_commitment, note_commitment, epk, zkproof)
byte[2144] input = abi.encode(input, anchor, nullifier, output1, output2, bindingSignature, signHash, frontier, leafCount)
bytes memory msg = verifyTransferProof(total_intput);
```

- The  parameters are specified as above 

```
[32 bytes for value_commitment][32 bytes for epk][64 bytes for spend_authority_signature][192 bytes for zkproof][32 bytes for value_commitment][32 bytes for note_commitment][32 bytes for epk][192 bytes for zkproof][32 bytes for value_commitment][32 bytes for note_commitment][32 bytes for epk][192 bytes for zkproof][32 bytes for anchor][32 bytes for nullifier][64 bytes for bindingSignature][32 bytes for signHash][1056 bytes for frontier][32 bytes for leafCount]
```

The length of `total_input` is 2144 bytes. For the output, the length of `msg` is 67~1059 bytes. The first byte is a bool value to indicate whether the proof verification succeeds, and the other bytes return the node value to construct the Merkle tree. The time cost of `verifyTransferProof` function takes about 15ms in parallel mode.

（3）`verifyBurnProof` 

`verifyBurnProof` function is used to verify the validity of zero-knowledge proof when transforming the shielded tokens back to  public TRC-20 tokens.  

```
byte[320] input = abi.encode(value_commitment, rk, spend_authority_signature, zkproof)
byte[488] total_input  = abi.encode(input, anchor, nullifier, value, bindingSignature, signHash)
bytes memory msg = verifyBurnProof(byte[488] input);
```

- `value` - the amout of shielded tokens to be made public
-  The  other parameters are specified as above 

```
[32 bytes for value_commitment][32 bytes for rk][64 bytes for spend_authority_signature][192 bytes for zkproof][32 bytes for anchor][32 bytes for nullifier][8 bytes for value][64 bytes for bindingSignature][32 bytes for signHash]
```

The length of `input` is 488 bytes. For the output, `msg` is a bool value to indicate whether the proof verification succeeds. The time cost of `verifyBurnProof` function takes about 10ms.

## Rationale

By introducing the zero-knowledge proof verification functions, it will be more convenient for shielded token contract implementation, which can providing users stronger privacy for shielded token transactions.
