People who wish to submit new TIPs, first should propose their idea or document in a new issue. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

If you would like to submit a TIP and it has already been written as a draft (see the [template](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips/blob/master/template.md) for an example), please submit it as a Pull Request.

It will merge yours immediately if certain criteria are met:

```
1.The PR edits only existing draft PRs.
2.The build passes.
3.Your Github username or email address is listed in the 'author' header of all affected PRs, inside .
4.If matching on email address, the email address is the one publicly listed on your GitHub profile.
```

Your first PR should be a first draft of the final TIP. It must meet the formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new TIP and assign it a number before merging it. 

Make sure you include a discussions-to header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the TIP as a whole.
